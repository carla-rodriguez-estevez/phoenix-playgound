# Phoenix Playground 
This is a repository created as a playgorund/training centre to improve my elixir and phoenix skills. 
The original organization of the project is to have a simple landing page with the projects already done and the tutorial/article se to create them and a few links for further information. The project idea is to have the recommendations in the issues section and given either resources of information regarding elixir, phoenix or mix or some general idea as "using thsi public API why don't you try to imnplement a front page to consume that information as this type of element". Improvements in the already existent code, repository, testing or design are more than welcome. 

I will try to update this project in my freetime and improve it as much as possible and keep a list with the taks and it's status.

The actual project now consistes on:
